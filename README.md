# VotingThing

Prompts and Ideas

A landing page where you can choose between the 2 candidates. 
    Display 2 candidates in the background and a simple voting screen

An on page load event 
    Something moving around

A mouse move event listener
    Voting button grows and shrinks slightly, as well as rotating

An onclick event listener
    Candidate 1 button spins and says "Thank you!", the candidate 2 button disappears

A context menu event
    Content Menu that says hello

A mouse over event listener and a mouse leave event listener
    Candidate 1 Button slowly grows and does not stop until no longer being hovered over
    Candidate 1 Button slowly shrinks and does not stop until no longer being hovered over

An object that moves around the page using clientX and clientY
    Something moving around

Using “this” for on clicks
    Just do that???

A loop that will create several elements at once
    Random Person Voted for candidate 1! On the bottom of the screen

Adding event listeners AND removing event listeners 
    Listen for when events occur to a voting button, and remove event listeners if it's candidate 1

A custom cursor either sometimes or always visible 
    mouse turns into click cursor on candidate 1,
    mouse turns into help cursor on candidate 2,
